- a single-cycle 32-bit RISC V core built using the <em>digital</em> logic CAD simulator, [see repo here](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital).  
- download all the files into one folder and open single_cycle_riscv_cpu.dig
- the cpu is currently confined to only these instructions: lw,sw,add,sub,and,or,slt,beq, addi, jal [more on the way]  
- feel free to add your contribution if you find it helpful (:
